# nodejs-demo

A nodejs based ( bun actually XD ) demo, where we have two parties:
- Seller: Wants to sell 1 Eth OTC for 5000 USDC
- Buyer: Wants to buy 1 Eth OTC for 5000 USDC

Seller is the wallet indexed 0 of default wallets that ship with the PXE, while Buyer is the wallet indexed 1 of the default wallets that ship with the PXE.

# Aztec OTC Escrow Contracts

Aztec Noir smart contracts implementing the core OTC escrow functionality for private and secure token swaps.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **OTC Escrow Contract**: Secure escrow mechanism for token swaps
- **Token Contract**: Standard token implementation for testing
- **Private Transfers**: Leverages Aztec's privacy features
- **Atomic Swaps**: Ensures both parties receive their tokens or the trade fails

## 📄 Smart Contracts

- `OTCEscrowContract`: Main escrow contract that holds seller's tokens until buyer fulfills the order
- `Token`: Standard token contract compatible with Aztec's privacy features
